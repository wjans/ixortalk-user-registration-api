= User Registration API

Depending on configuration of the platform, it will be backed by either an AuthServer within the same platform or Auth0.

== AuthServer

=== Register User

Rest call to register a new user in the platform.  Configurable default roles will be assigned.

==== Request

Via curl:
include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/ok/curl-request.adoc[]

HTTP request:
include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/ok/http-request.adoc[]

===== Request Fields
include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/ok/request-fields.adoc[]

==== Response

When everything is ok:

include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/ok/http-response.adoc[]

When the request body is invalid:

include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/invalid-request-body/http-response.adoc[]

When the authserver returns an error, the HTTP status code returned by the auth server is propagated back to the client too:

include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/error-returned-by-authserver/http-response.adoc[]

=== Update User

Rest call to update logged in user

=== Register User

Rest call to register a new user in Auth0.  This user will be created as a blocked user without receiving an email.  This call is to be used to encapsulate user registration in client API's, where the user can be unblocked later.

When the Auth0 returns an bad request, the error description is passed to the client:

include::{snippets}/auth0/register/bad-request-returned-by-auth0/http-response.adoc[]

When Auth0 returns any other status code, this status code is propagated without exposing a description.
